The goal of this dashboard is to provide insights into sales performance, product categories, customer behavior, and budget comparisons.

Problem Statement:
The Bike Haven aims to enhance its online sales reports by transitioning from static reports to interactive dashboards. The focus is on tracking sales volume of products, clients, and timeline.

Additionally, he wants to compare sales figures against the budget for each month.
